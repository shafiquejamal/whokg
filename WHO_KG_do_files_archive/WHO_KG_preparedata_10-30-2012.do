// Source: #1_e95045.pdf "Health Systems in Transition"
//  page 47 "Exemption categories were drawn up on the basis of social considerations and disease types, with the aim of protecting vulnerable groups of the population and those with the highest expected use of health services."
//	page 48 "In the process of implementing the SGBP, there has been a considerable increase in the population categories entitled to various forms of exemption, from 29 categories in 2001 to 72 in 2009. This increase in the number of exempt categories was accompanied by an increase in the number of patients entitled to exemptions...
//		In order to ensure that increased state commitments correspond to available financing, an inventory of legislative documents regulating exemptions was envisaged...
//		Patients who fall below the poverty line but are not entitled to exemptions can receive basic health services paid for by the reserve fund of health organizations. These are mostly men and women, except pregnant women, who are of working age. However, at present the mechanisms for this exemption are not well defined. "
//  page 80 "The levels of co-payments, as well as the patient categories exempted from co-payments or entitled to reduced rates, are defined in the SGBP"
//  page 126 "Increased levels of funding allowed certain groups to be exempted from co-payments, including children under 5 years of age, pensioners older than 70 years, and women for prenatal care and deliveries"
//  		...so is it 70 or 75 years of age? Do they have to be a "pensioner"?

//  page 281-282 "Targeting based on social categories. Assistance was intended to reach economi- cally vulnerable groups, but they were defined largely in terms of social and demographic characteristics, whereas, for example, war veterans, people over 5 years of age, and the disabled regardless of their income were fully exempt from any fees."
//				"Targeting based on medical condition/disease type. Interventions to prevent and cure diseases with important public health consequences and externalities were also exempt from charges (TB, AIDS, syphilis, polio, diphtheria)."
